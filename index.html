            <p>
                In this absurd reality, there exists a <em>poor Ph.D. student</em> with a grand ambition to change the world of medicine, yet he’s suffocating under the weight of a <strong>meager scholarship</strong>. Every day, rent and living expenses drain him dry, his meals are cobbled together, and his life feels thinner than instant noodles. But despite his hardships, he clings to his dream with determination: designing a groundbreaking technology called <strong>lung-on-a-chip</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One late night, as he stared at his computer in exhaustion, inspiration struck—why not let <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> take a shot? He fed his concepts and data into the <strong>AI</strong>, letting it handle precise calculations and simulations. Astonishingly, the <strong>AI</strong> returned a flawless "blueprint." Following this <strong>AI</strong>-generated model, he crafted a tiny yet realistic lung-on-a-chip that could mimic <strong>lung regeneration and development</strong>, allowing him to conduct in-depth studies on <strong>lung cancer</strong> and test <strong>new drugs</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This technology was nothing short of extraordinary. It promised to drastically cut the costs of <strong>clinical trials</strong>, serve as a new <strong>drug screening platform</strong>, and even <strong>replace animal testing</strong>, paving the way for a more humane and efficient approach in medicine. Yet, just as he was on the brink of achieving his dream, reality hit him once more. His funds were drained, and the <strong>meager scholarship</strong> barely let him breathe. Monthly rent alone was a struggle, and even basic sustenance was becoming a daily challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this moment, <strong>he urgently needed outside support</strong>—not only for his own survival but to bring this vital technology to life. Each breath he took became a reminder of why he was fighting. He knew that with the right support, the <strong>lung-on-a-chip</strong> could revolutionize medicine and benefit countless lives.
